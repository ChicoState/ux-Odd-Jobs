Jonathan is a 20 year old business major at CSU Chico. He has been focusing on his studies and this year he wants to take a short break. His schedule has been cleared up to give him more time to explore what has been happening around the campus and potentially earn some money on the side. The last part-time job he worked at had hours that did not agree with this schedule and he would rather work on his own time.

Jonathan has not had the time to meet with other students in his major and he figures now would probably be a good time to do so. “Building connections with other people in my major would be great, and earning some spending money on the side would be the cherry on top.”

Goals:
  - A way to meet other people in his major to build connections
  - Flexibility in when he works
