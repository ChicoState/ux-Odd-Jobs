Jonathan is a 20 year old business major at CSU Chico. He has been focusing on his studies and this year he wants to take a short break. His schedule has been cleared up to give him more time to explore what has been happening around the campus and potentially earn some money on the side. The last part-time job he worked at had hours that did not agree with this schedule and he would rather work on his own time.

Jonathan has not had the time to meet with other students in his major and he figures now would probably be a good time to do so. “Building connections with other people in my major would be great, and earning some spending money on the side would be the cherry on top.”

Goals:
  - A way to meet other people in his major to build connections
  - Flexibility in when he works

Persona 2 - Marcus

Marcus is a 21 year old student from CSU Chico. He has been living alone for his last year in college and so far his dog, Buzz has been nothing but trouble. He typically is stuck on campus all day and most of the night since after his courses he needs to go to work for a few hours. He doesn’t get home until 9-10pm on most nights.

His dog Buzz has been having a hard time adjusting since now he is alone for a large portion of the day. He ends up causing a mess in the house since he has more energy than room to expel that energy. Marcus feels bad for Buzz, since he knows it really isn’t his fault for messing up the apartment. “I need to find a way to get Buzz’s energy out so that he doesn't mess up the house anymore. Dog daycare is too expensive and there’s not enough room inside for him to play and I don't want to leave him outside all day.”

Goals:
  - Stop Buzz from messing up his(Marcus) apartment
  - Needs to be an affordable solution since Marcus doesn’t have a lot of money
  - Can’t be disruptive to Marcus’s already packed schedule

# Scenarios

Johnathan

The next semester is coming around and one of Jonathan’s classes requires a textbook that costs $75. He would apply for a job in town, but unfortunately he does not have the time to go through the interview process. He recently downloaded the app Odd-Jobs, after getting it recommended by another classmate. He would like to purchase the book in the shortest amount of time possible because shipping times for it may stretch into the week when classes begin if he buys it later.

Marcus

Marcus is a college student who has a dog that has a lot of energy and not a lot of ways to express the energy without causing havoc. Marcus is looking for a way to get Buzz a reliable dog walker who is within his small budget. He wants to make sure Buzz gets the attention he needs. Marcus’s coworker tells him about Odd Jobs, so he downloads our app. He gets worried that he won’t be able to find anyone within his budget, since he has read that walkers can charge up to 30 per dog per hour. He finds a walker that fits his budget, finds their availability and schedules Buzz for daily hour-long walks at 3:30pm for $10/hr.
