# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

Initial research and design for Odd-Jobs was focused on **identifying who students and normal people were**, as well as an **easy way to post and take jobs**.

* Competitive analysis revealed an opportunity to focus on a specific audience of users:
  - College Focused: Intended for **use by college students** and those that live around those communities
  - Simple jobs: Keep the scale/scope of jobs low to ensure proper completion
* Heuristic evaluation identified competitor strengths and weaknesses in user interface:
  - Unified design elements
  - **Opens new tabs** instead of staying in one tab
  - **Inconsistent menu placement** across new areas
* New personas and scenarios indicate the needs of the users:
  - Easily **identifiable student status**
  - Accessible way to accept and post jobs
* Sketches and diagrams detail initial design concepts:
  - Quick navigation through various menus and submenus
  - **Seach filter** for new job postings
  - **Icon for student status** next to username

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

Phase II was dedicated to developing new features and improving existing ones. We set out to make a UI that would ensure we achieve strong user retention through **solid features and good UI design**.

* Over this sprint, we elicited informal feedback and had independent testers perform Cognitive Walkthroughs on existing wireframes
  - We learned our original designs didn’t have enough depth to accomplish core functionality
  - Users prefer a separate interface for posters and “employees”
* Over this next sprint, we will work to improve wireframes to **make our app more learnable** and make it clear to users the expected workflow
  - The caveats from this research are that our app was not fully functional at the demo, which limited our ability to **get deeper feedback**
